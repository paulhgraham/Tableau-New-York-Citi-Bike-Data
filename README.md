# Tableau-New-York-Citi-Bike-Data

Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report using multiple datasets from different periods.  

Note: Due to the large file size of these CSV, they are unable to be uploaded to github. To locate the data used for this project go to: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

Download the following files:
- 2013-07 - Citi Bike trip data.csv
- 2013-08 - Citi Bike trip data.csv
- 2013-09 - Citi Bike trip data.csv
- 2013-10 - Citi Bike trip data.csv

From there, the jupyter notebook can be used to format the data and produce the citibike_2018.csv file used in the visual display in Tableau.

An example of one of the outputs is below:
